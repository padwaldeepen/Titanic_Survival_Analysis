# Titanic_Survival_Analysis

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after colliding with an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. An estimated 2,224 passengers and crew were onboard the ship, and more than 1,500 drowned, making it one of the worst maritime peacetime shipping disasters in modern history.

Goals


--> Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages, Gender, Class, Etc.)

-->	What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

-->	Where did the passengers come from?

-->	Who was alone and who was with family?

-->	Did the deck affect the passenger's survival rate? Did this answer match up with your intuition?

-->	Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?

Conclusion

--> Age does not play many roles in assessing the likelihood of survival.

--> Sex is considered so that women had greater chances of survival than men and children.

--> Women of Pclass-1 and children of Pclass-2 have the highest chance of survival from others. However, being a child or a woman may not be considered as a 100 percent chance of survival.
